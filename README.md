# Steam Price Tracker

This project is a **Steam Game Price Tracker** with a **GUI (Tkinter)** and **web interface (Flask)**. It lets you:

* Add Steam games by **AppID**, **store link**, or even a **search link**.
* Automatically fetch current price & discount info from the Steam API.
* Get notified on **WhatsApp** (via Twilio) when tracked games are **10% off or more**.
* Manage games through either:

  * A **desktop GUI** (Tkinter)
  * A **local web interface** (Flask, [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002))

---

## Features

* GUI for adding/removing games to track
* Save/load tracked games from `games.json`

  * Search results (`/search/?term=...`)

## Notes

* Steam API sometimes rate-limits â†’ if you get HTTP 429, wait before retrying.
* Free games will show as `Free (0% off)`.
* On macOS, you may see a `Tk deprecation` warning â€” safe to ignore.
* Im still working on getting the steamAPI to work
